# MNIST Dataset Classification Using Artificial Neural Network

The MNIST dataset is a image dataset which contains different image of numbers from 0 to 9 i.e. it has total of 10 classes.The image format is 28 * 28 pixel.  We have a total number of 60000 images that is used for the project. A sample of images from the dataset is shown below.

We have developed a Artificial Neural Network wholy from the scratch without using any modelling libraries. The mentioned program uses only numpy library. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 91% on the test set. Following graph shows the accuracy rate with number of epochs.
